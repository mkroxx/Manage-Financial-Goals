Project instructions


Project title : Create & manage financial goals



Project Description : User should be able to create and manage his financial goals by using  Web app User interface.



Technologies to be used: 

	-DB: Mysql

	-Spring boot (version >=2.0)

	-Spring

	-JPA with hibernate

	-Any front end javascript framework like angular/ react OR plain html, css, javascript, jquery etc



1)Design DB and write Restful API services, integrated with frontend web app to achieve following requirements

	User can create n number of goals having dynamic value of goal target.

	-E.g. As a user I can define "Purchase iPhone" as my financial goal. 

	-This goal will have target amount let's say 1000

	-which can be achieved by micro savings (any value between 100 & 500) 

		*User can select this micro saving value dynamically.

	-E.g. to achieve target amount of goal (i.e. 1000) User can make 4 transactions with 200, 100, 200 , 500

	-User should be able to see his micro saving transactions at any point of time.

	-User should not be able to add micro saving transactions, in goal, once it is completed.

	-User should be able to delete goal.

	

	

2)Add proper server side validation wherever required.



3)Logging and exception handling should be added in code, at appropriate location in code.
